# ac_code_test
Atlas Copco code test for testers

Two methods in the module 'various_methods.py' were tested and tests were placed in separate test modules:
test_convert_to_atlas_copco.py and
test_reverse_string.py

pytest was used for the unit tests, hence this might need to be installed initally by a new user, in a cmd window:
pip install pytest

PyCharm is recommended to use as a Python IDE

Bugs found in the methods tested are described in a separate text file:
bugs.txt
