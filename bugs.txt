Bugs in methods:

In the two methods I focused on, I found a bug in one of them:

ConvertToAtlasCopcoString:
    Bug found with test case test_convert_ok when all valid values were looped to test the method.
    The test case fail when reaching integer = 87
    Instead of "Atlas" (87 is divisible by 3) "ERROR" is returned
